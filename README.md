### Russell 2000 components: Financial analysis based on Reese Interpretation of Warren Buffett

The objective of this small project is to identify the 'top' investable companies based on any theoretical concepts and the methodology explained by Reese in his book 'The Guru Investor'. Particularly, in the page 109 regarding 'The Buffett Strategy: Step by Step'
A. Theoretic framework. 

WB corresponds to the REESE method to try to look for companies based on numeric criteria in the vein of Warren Buffett investment ideas. This is an analysis of the Russell 2000 stocks from data comming from Yahoo finance.  Close to 2000 companies were screened, with yearly finanacials from 2020-2023. The full Warren Buffett investment technique is described by REESE book  The Guru Investor pag. 111
The metodology is simple. It is of interest group companies based on financials, regardless the industry of size. In the search of a 'good' company as described by REESE we want to normalize and scale the data. To scale the data we divide by its yearly revenue. To normalize the data we use basic vector normalization.
A.1. Any of the Reese method based on his Buffett approach.
1. Earnings Predictability Y1 > Y2... >Yn

   Searching in DB the candidates based on increasing yearly EPS in the last 4 years. The code to achieve thi first task is in WB.sql and WB.py. This data comes from the russell database.
    This was done en the candidates where: 'APG', 'ATI', 'CHRD','COKE','DOC', 'ENSG','EXLS','FI', 'GTLS','MLI','ONTO','PSN', 'SFN','UFPI','SUM','SSD','WTS'.
    While doing this analysis, I noticed there were interesting materials producer companies that had steady earnings growth with high debt level.

2. Long Term Debt < 5 earnings.
   
   After applying the second requeriment the list was reduced further to CHRD, COKE, ENSG, EXLS, MLI, ONTO, PSN, SSD, UFPI, WTS.
   After applying the Warren Buffet method described by Reese we endup with few, 9 companies that have positive earnings and that have reasonable debt. The code is available in WD.py and WD.sql

3. Return On equity

   The idea i sto use ROIC defined as NOPAT/ Invested Capital, where NOPAT = EBIT(1-Tax Rate). Invested Capital= Total Debt+Equity−Cash and Cash Equivalents
A.2 Normalization

B. Data Download and exploration
B.1 Data from Yahoo was download and programatically and visually analyzed. Few candidates were analyzed

Using a Basic research method based on Reese approach to Warren Buffett way of investing, we came accross with Coca-Cola (COKE) thus, the method might be interesting indeed. We came accross with CHRD which is a company in the oil industry. Buffett has companies in this sector. Notice that the method requires 10Y statement analysis, here we consider only 4Y and yet, from about 2000 companies, we get less than 10 that fullfill this basic criteria. Notice COKE dropped from the Russell 2000 index in 2024, but it was up to 2023.





There are other requirements with many projections like free cash flow and stock price and return on investment in the comming 10 years. Thinking this is Buffett method is controversial. Therefore, we stop here. We just want to identify a bunch of good companies based in these basic numbers. This is wider accepted, i.e. a company with low debt, with hight ROE, and with strong margins and low capital expenditure is a good company. Other aspects are less numerical, like re-investment oportunities or protective moat. This wont be quantified.

Based on a group of companies like these ones we will ask to ChatGPT to give us a list of companies simmilar in these metrics, after this we make a list of these companies to be notified when they get cheap. Additionally, new investment desicion will be compared against with these companies to draw conclusions about valuations. A new entrant in the portfolio should offer a higher potential reward than the ones already in the portfolio. 
The first problem with asking ChatGPT to look for companies similar to the list hereup, is that the search will result in companies in the same sector, same size and so forth, whereas, we look for good companies not matter the sector or the size. Notice additionally, that we rely on yahoo, as it provide us with already standardize data, but we need at least 10 years of financials, or we may be interested in small or unknown companies requiring finacial standardization, just to be able to fee the data into the model.

One approach to make companies more comparable is to present all financial data in terms of the percentage respect to the total revenue. This way we center all data arround 1. This way te embeddings will be more comparable accross companies. 
The following is the SQL query. EBIT > 30% and Total debt less than 3X its revenue. These requirements are 'at least once' or at least in one of the years analyzed.
So far there is only one company that summarizes what we are looking for. Casually, it is undervalued. Its name is Diodes Inc. Hereunder its profile

The idea is thus to use this and selected companies to define what is a healthy company. About 20 companies where selected: DIOD EVRI FWRD GRBK HCKT HDSN IDCC JBI KAI MATX MCRI METCB MHO MTH NRC SHLS TH UHG XPEL.

At the end the following companies were chosen 'TH','MATX', 'HDSN','MCRI','IDCC','SHLS','MTH','KAI','FWRD' and 'XPEL'. The approach to chosing these companies was by means of stability in their earnings, retained earnings, low debt, positive operating earnings and operating cashflow. The following table show the type of comparative tables that were calculated. all the values have beeing divided by its corresponding revenue for each company. This type of analysis is more interesting when considering two companies from the same industry. The following are for instance two building companies MTH and UHG. The 'fistres' columns refer to the percentagers respect to the revenue for that year for that company. 'chgn' represents the change from year to year, since we consider only 4 years, only 3 year changes are calculated. None of these two companies were chosen and they serve here as an example.

Following table presents the Cosine Distance between financials of chosen companies. It can be seing that FWRD and MATX have a cosine distance very close to 100 for the year 2022. This is expected. Normally, the cosine distance goes here from -100 to 100. values close to -100 or 100 indicate strong similarity. FWRD and MATX are logistic companies with similar economics, therefore you expect them to have scores closer to 100 compared to companies from different industries or different ways of operate. This tecnique is important to identify companies whose financials diverge from companies within the same industry or with simmilar economics.

I use this method to choose solid companies accross the years. Here 'fistresn' and 'change' are normalized variables comming from the finanacials after dividing by revenue. To finish, notice that KAI and FWRD are very close as well, despite these companies are in different industries. The reason for this is that both companies have very similar economics. KAI is a flow control company.
